## Unattended weekly source refresh

The Wednesday refresh runs at 07:17 UTC, or through the `refresh` dispatch on
`main`. It fetches only admitted publisher destinations. Exact host and GitHub
repository rules apply before requests and redirects; refreshed datasets cannot
expand that authority. Source discovery and version changes must retain publisher
evidence and pass independent inventory reconciliation and baseline checks.

Each source owns a bounded set of outputs. A failed candidate restores that
source's previously accepted files and records quarantine; unrelated sources
continue. Final validation checks the combined candidate before publication.
The run report at `.local/source-refresh-results.json` records accepted and
quarantined sources. `tools/report-refresh-alerts.mjs` creates, updates or reopens
one generated GitHub issue per quarantined source, and closes it after an explicit
accepted recovery. Missing or untouched source results never imply recovery.
Alert delivery errors fail the job.
Nightly sweeps and weekly refreshes have separate incident labels, so an
unrelated successful schedule cannot close a failed refresh's alert. Disabling
repository Issues fails the alert job instead of silently degrading to a warning.

Refresh health measures faithful handling of publisher material, not perfection
of the publisher's metadata. Unchanged official content is healthy; the shared
HTTP cache revalidates responses instead of treating publication age as failure.
NIST discovery retains assets from unavailable pages with an explicit retention
reason. NARA keeps previously disclosed missing detail pages visible, while loss
of any previously accepted detail blocks the candidate. OLIR submissions without
importable mappings remain individually recorded and quarantined; they do not
block unrelated mappings. Previously imported mappings remain protected.
If an existing OLIR submission cannot be fetched, its exact accepted mapping
bytes and original provenance are retained. Separate `refresh_status`,
`refresh_error` and `latest_retrieval_attempts` fields disclose the failed check;
`retained_count` reports these submissions. Successful retrieval replaces the
retained version and clears those fields automatically. Retention does not admit
the submitter's external host into the official-source fetch allowlist.
How retained submissions affect the source issue is described under Refresh
decisions and health below.

NIST OLIR registers developer-hosted mappings; an official catalog entry does
not make its assertions NIST-authored or NIST-endorsed. The
[catalog](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir/informative-reference-catalog) validates
submission requirements, and the [FAQ](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/olir/faqs)
explicitly describes developer hosting. Registered artifact paths for submissions
are granted per submission from the current NIST detail response, within audited
public hosting services. GitHub discovery stays within the registered directory
and branch; other directories remain outside the grant. SCF content-host redirects
preserve the registered path, and Google export redirects preserve the registered
document ID. New filenames within a registered GitHub directory need no code edit.
Zenodo DOI redirects preserve the registered record ID. Discovery starts only
from the NIST detail's submission or JSON artifact URL; reference publication
pages cannot supply substitute mappings or unrelated workbooks.
Workbook ingestion reads every sheet with relationship headers, preserves sheet
and row locators, and stores strength and explanation separately from relationship
type. Spreadsheet presentation objects are excluded from cell-data parsing.
Registered public landing pages may expose structured downloads or explicit
relationship tables. Discovery grants only linked artifact locations on audited
hosts; it does not grant arbitrary redirects or sibling paths. CSV parsing
preserves quoted commas and multiline cells. HTML extraction preserves the
published framework identifiers and row or paragraph locators. Its
`extraction_scope: published_html_relationships` means only the relationships
actually printed on that page, which may be a publisher-selected subset. It is
not a claim that the complete registered crosswalk is available.

Each manifest entry records `availability`: structured artifact, published HTML
relationships, access restricted, download replaced by HTML, no public mapping
discovered, retrieval failure, parse failure, or outside the active catalog/Final
scope. These are observations, not guesses about unpublished material. The
weekly run retries applicable entries, including previously unavailable ones.
Within a run, each artifact gets at most one delayed retry for rate limiting,
server/network failures, or HTML returned at a workbook URL. Both attempts remain
in its retrieval evidence and count toward the existing request ceiling.
Persistent failures retain accepted data; authentication failures and retired
downloads do not trigger retries. `unexpected_html_response` distinguishes a
bad workbook response from a redirect to a generic download page.
It never fills out publisher forms, bypasses authentication, or substitutes a
current workbook for an older registered download that redirects to a generic
page. A previously accepted mapping remains protected by retention and admission
checks regardless of its current availability.

Recurring identical source alerts retain their original issue and occurrence
link; changed diagnostics, new failures and recovery update the issue. Each
subprocess has a 15-minute deadline and preserves failure diagnostics.

Audited repository transfers resolve IBM/compliance-trestle to
oscal-compass/compliance-trestle and mitre/caldera to apache/caldera. GitHub's
repository API supplies that transfer evidence; arbitrary redirects do not expand
the allowlist. The existing public DoD RAI Toolkit summary is admitted at
`https://rai.acqbot.com/executive-summary`; official Army UTP 3-10.4 identifies
that toolkit in its AI guidance. Assessment application routes remain outside
the fetch boundary.

After repository verification and SBOM generation, a repository-scoped GitHub
App creates a ready PR on `automation/source-refresh`. Independent PR CI and
security runs must pass for its current commit. The merge workflow verifies the
App author, branch, allowed JSON paths and clean merge state, then requests a
squash merge of that exact SHA. Routine validated refreshes need no human review;
failed checks, blocked branch protection and quarantined sources remain visible
for intervention. Production deployment follows the normal validated `main`
artifact path.

Configure `REFRESH_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `REFRESH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` for the
`control-atlas-source-refresh` App, installed only on this repository with contents
and pull-request write permissions. The refresh job uses its separate Actions
token for source requests and issue alerts; it obtains the App token only after
validation. Required branch protections remain binding.

## Refresh decisions and health

A large count change is not proof of corruption, and a small one is not proof of
health. A candidate outside the accepted count band is accepted only with
evidence it did not write about itself:

- the publisher revision proves itself (new version, new downloaded bytes,
  complete identity reconciliation); or
- the publisher's own inventory reconciles to the candidate exactly (for DISA,
  every listed publication ingested, none failed or missing) and no more than
  the policy's removal ceiling (default 5 percent) of previously accepted
  identities disappeared.

Anything else is quarantined, and the issue states how many identities were
added, removed and changed. Mass removal is never accepted on a count match.

Reviewed commits can change data without going through refresh (for example a
fix that ingests more publications). The committed data is what production
serves, so refresh adopts it as the reference, still subject to the record floor
and independent-inventory rules, and records the adoption in
`data/source-change-log.json`. A stale baseline can no longer fail every later
refresh.

Every accepted change is written to `data/source-change-log.json` by the run
that accepted it: catalog, previous and current identity (count, checksum,
publisher version when the publisher exposes one), added, removed and changed
counts, lifecycle transitions and accepted time. A field is `null` when it was
not measured. No publisher version is ever invented. The admission gate
recomputes the log and rejects a pull request whose log does not match.

Retrieval failures are separated by whether asking again could help. Timeouts,
dropped connections, HTTP 408, 425, 429 and 5xx are retried: at most three
requests per URL, waiting 1 and 2 seconds (a `Retry-After` is honored up to 15
seconds), each with a 60 second timeout. A whole source that failed that way is
attempted again after 15 seconds, up to its declared attempts. HTTP 404 and 403,
validation rejections and parse errors are the publisher's current answer and are
not retried. The DISA archive keeps its own per-range retry, so the transport
makes one request per attempt there. No mirror is ever contacted. When attempts run out, the source keeps
its accepted files and is quarantined honestly.

OLIR submissions whose mapping can no longer be downloaded keep their exact
accepted mapping and are a recorded limitation, not an incident, when NIST
answered and publishes none (`retention.cause` is `publisher_unavailable`). A
failure that looks temporary is also quiet, until it repeats for three
consecutive refreshes; then the source is quarantined and one issue opens. This
replaces the earlier rule that any retained submission kept the source issue open
forever. Retention with no recorded cause still keeps it open.

Three alert states exist on purpose and must not be merged into one health state:

- **Source alert** (`control-atlas-refresh:<source>` issues, for example OLIR or DISA):
  closes when that one source is accepted, or safely retained under its partial
  policy with the limitation recorded.
- **Aggregate refresh alert** (`sweep-red-refresh`): closes only when the whole
  refresh job, including repository verification, succeeds. A source can recover
  while this alert stays open.
- **Nightly product alert** (`sweep-red-nightly`): closes only when the Sunday
  sweep's build, browser and accessibility jobs pass.

Tests must not pin numbers that a publisher changes. A valid refresh once broke
two tests that hard-coded the CCI-000366 mapping count; read or derive such
counts from the record under test.

One issue exists per failing sweep. `tools/report-sweep-alert.mjs` names only the
jobs that failed, updates the issue when the failing set changes, and closes it
when the sweep next passes. A job the sweep schedules that was skipped counts as
red, so a sweep that did not run cannot look green. Jobs are never marked
`continue-on-error`.

## Right-sized automation

Do the least work that keeps the trust: stop as soon as the answer is known.

| Trigger | Check or fetch | Validation | Rebuild scope | Test scope | Deploy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wednesday refresh, nothing changed | Conditional GET per source (304 when unchanged) | Baseline band, identity and inventory rules | None. `tools/classify-refresh-outcome.mjs` restores the tree | None | No PR, no deploy |
| Wednesday refresh, source changed | Same fetch | Per-source transaction, evidence and admission gate | Full generated-data build (the graph is one dependency unit) | Repository verification, then independent PR CI and Security | Automerge, then verified deploy |
| Wednesday refresh, quiet for 21 days | Same fetch | Same | Bookkeeping dates only | Same | PR and deploy, so "last checked" stays inside the 45-day window |
| Pull request | Not applicable | Change map picks affected gates | Affected build | Affected unit, contract and browser subset | No |
| Merge to `main` | Not applicable | Full required CI, Security | Full site build | Full gates, Lighthouse budgets | Verified deploy, production smoke and Lighthouse |
| Sunday sweep | Not applicable | Full generated-data contracts | Full site build | All browsers, complete accessibility | No |
| Monthly OSCAL | Not applicable | Independent OSCAL cross-check | None | OSCAL validation | No |

Measured cost (2026-09): refresh data phase about 5 minutes (hydration 97
seconds and resource enrichment 90 seconds dominate); main CI about 4.5 minutes
wall; deploy about 4 minutes; the Sunday sweep about 60 runner minutes (build 5
minutes, six browser shards 6 to 9 minutes each, accessibility 2.3 minutes).

The Sunday sweep is the deliberate deep confidence run. It exists because pull
request CI runs one browser engine and a subset of specs, so Firefox, WebKit and
the full spec list are only exercised there. It does not re-prove source
integrity, which the Wednesday refresh and its admission gate already cover, and
it runs weekly rather than nightly because unchanged code does not need daily
proof. Refresh cadence is one weekly job because unchanged sources cost a 304,
not a download; per-source cadence would add scheduling without measured savings.

## Local gates

### Production performance measurement

`npm run lighthouse:production` uses two fixed host warmups followed by three
measured cold-browser runs. All three measured runs enter the median; scores do
not trigger retries or selective sampling. LCP, TBT and CLS budgets remain
2500 ms, 200 ms and 0.1. Missing metrics and Lighthouse runtime failures fail
closed. Reports, traces and DevTools logs are retained for diagnosis.

Host warmups follow Lighthouse's
[variance guidance](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/variability.md).
They address observed cold-run/garbage-collection variance, not application
regressions. A failed median still fails deployment verification and must be
investigated from the saved reports. Express's transitive `qs` override retains
the compatible security-fixed version until Express updates its own dependency.

### Recover a validated refresh PR

If a refresh passes ingestion, repository verification and SBOM generation but
cannot create its PR, retain `automation/source-refresh`. Dispatch **Control Atlas
CI** on `main` with task `recover-refresh-pr`, the original `refresh_run_id`, and
the full `refresh_head_sha` recorded in the failed PR action. Recovery verifies
the run, snapshot parent, recorded SHA and data-only changes before creating a
draft using the Actions token. It never refetches data or merges the draft.
This recovery route is an operator fallback; its draft is not eligible for the
App-authored automatic merge path above.

Use `npm run refresh:recover-pr -- --verify-only` with `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`,
`REFRESH_RUN_ID` and `REFRESH_HEAD_SHA` to inspect the proof without creating a PR.

### Build and verification commands

- `npm run build:data` rebuilds and reconciles generated source truth.
- `npm run build:site` produces `dist/site`.
- `npm run verify:quality` runs discovery, manifest, hygiene, OSCAL, lint, type, unit, browser-contract, DOM, and public-artifact gates.
- `npm run resources:enrich` refreshes README facts and presentation evidence for supported repositories; `npm run resources:validate-media` verifies attributable image responses.
- `npm run verify:ingestion` checks the shared ten-stage lifecycle for all catalog artifacts, all publisher catalogs, and all Resources entries.
- `npm run test:a11y:smoke` checks representative accessibility paths.
- `npm run test:e2e:smoke` checks representative product workflows.
- `npm run precommit` is the complete local ship gate.
- `npm run verify:affected` prints changed paths, selected checks, approximate
  test count, workers, and runtime budget without executing them.
- `npm run verify:affected -- --run` executes that bounded plan. Unknown data or
  UI paths fail closed until a source-specific or route-family mapping exists.

Use the cheapest faithful contract test during development. No routine
iteration step may exceed 50 tests or two minutes; the affected runner enforces
those per-step limits. Run corpus rebuilds and browser matrices only at final
integration unless a changed input explicitly invalidates their evidence.

`packageManager` pins the npm resolver used to validate lockfiles against CI.
`npm run verify:lockfile` checks isolated copies of the manifests with that npm
version, so existing local dependencies cannot conceal missing lock entries.
Refresh dependency metadata with
`npm exec --yes --package=npm@10.9.8 -- npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`.
Keep the resolver pin and this command aligned when upgrading npm.

## Shipping contract

1. Work on a feature branch and keep commits narrow.
2. Pass the printed affected local gate for each phase. Run the complete local
   ship gate once after final Epic inputs freeze.
3. Push with `npm run git:push` and open a pull request to `main`.
4. Require exact-head CI and security checks to pass.
5. Verify a fresh checkout of the remote branch.
6. Merge through the repository ship flow; never merge locally around CI.
7. Verify the deployed `release.json` commit equals merged `main` and that its separately labeled product-release and source-data timestamps match the rendered footer.
8. Inspect representative live desktop and mobile routes, keyboard behavior, overflow, and key source records.
9. Keep release evidence in CI artifacts, the pull request, and the release—not a dated documentation file.
10. Delete the completed `docs/Plan.md`, remove clean temporary worktrees and merged local branches, and prune worktrees.

## Evidence boundaries

Automated browser emulation is not physical-device evidence. Automated axe is not hands-on NVDA, VoiceOver, or TalkBack evidence. Report those external checks as unverified until they actually occur. A release may proceed only when the owner has explicitly accepted any remaining non-blocking external evidence gap.

An obsolete public hostname for an earlier release still exists in the wild and returns a GitHub Pages 404. The account that publishes Control Atlas does not own that repository, so no redirect can be published from here; the 404 is an external ownership limitation, not a defect this repository can close. `tests/browser-contract.test.mjs` fails the build if any tracked product or documentation file reintroduces that hostname. Publish a canonical redirect only if the legacy Pages property ever becomes available.

## Runtime boundary

The deployed site is static and public-data-only. It has no backend, authentication, telemetry, user uploads, organizational data, compliance scoring, operational integrations, or stored generated templates.
