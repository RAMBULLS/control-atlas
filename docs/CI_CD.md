# Control Atlas CI/CD

- **Owner:** Nexus and Pixel
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-09-29
- **Supersession:** Update this contract and the corresponding workflows or package scripts in the same change.

Control Atlas separates validation, source-refresh merging and deployment while
sharing one immutable site artifact.

## Workflow responsibilities

- `ci.yml` classifies changes once, runs independent quality gates, builds the site once, and publishes `site-build` for the exact commit SHA.
- `security.yml` runs dependency review, CodeQL, secret scanning, and repository hygiene without rebuilding the site.
- `deploy.yml` accepts only a successful `main` push CI run, verifies `release.json`, deploys that exact artifact, waits for the same SHA at the public edge, then runs production smoke and Lighthouse checks.
- `automerge-refresh.yml` runs after successful refresh PR CI or security
  completion. It loads merge tooling from `main`, requires both workflows to
  succeed for the current PR SHA, and merges only the admitted App-authored
  `automation/source-refresh` PR after path and branch-protection checks.

## Pull request graph

`Change map` determines which gates are required. Lint, types, unit tests, build, contracts, browser shards, accessibility, visual regression, Lighthouse, and workflow lint report independently. `Required CI` fails if any selected gate fails or is cancelled.

The final `checks` job mirrors `Required CI` for compatibility with the repository's existing protected-branch status context. It does not bypass or duplicate validation.

Routine checkout uses depth 1 and fetches only the comparison base SHA. Full history is reserved for the scheduled deep secret scan.

## Change-map policy

- Runtime, style, data, dependency, and browser-test changes produce a site artifact and exercise the relevant browser gates.
- Data and dependency changes force a deterministic full build.
- Automation-only changes run automation lint, CI contracts, and actionlint
  without generated data, a site build, product tests, browser matrices, or
  unrelated security jobs.
- Documentation-only changes run hygiene and prose-style contracts without a
  product build.
- Audit evidence changes run the narrow evidence-integrity gate and do not deploy.
- Unknown paths fail closed as runtime code.

## Generated data ownership

`data/generated/` is derived build output. It is ignored by Git and reconstructed from versioned publisher snapshots, curated corrections, registries, schemas, maps, parsers, and generators.

`npm run generate:data` produces the complete derived data surface. CI caches it by canonical-input hash and publishes it as an immutable intermediate artifact. The site build and data-dependent tests consume that same artifact, while browser, accessibility, Lighthouse, and deployment consume the validated `site-build` artifact.

`npm run verify:generated-reproducibility` performs two clean generations and requires identical file counts, byte counts, and SHA-256 tree digests. Generation uses `CONTROL_ATLAS_GENERATED_AT`, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, or the latest versioned source-observation date, in that order, so output does not depend on a prior generated directory, an unrelated UI commit, or wall-clock time.

Atomic JSON writers preserve identical files and mtimes. `npm run
build:site:incremental` preserves validated staged data and recompresses only
changed JSON while rebuilding application assets.

Scheduled refreshes persist an ignored HTTP cache between runs and issue strict
conditional requests. A 304 reuses previously cached bytes; network failure may
not return stale cached bytes during a required-fresh run. Every request and
redirect must satisfy the static publisher URL policy. GitHub access is limited
to admitted owner/repository pairs and endpoint paths.

The Wednesday 07:17 UTC refresh isolates each source candidate and restores its
last accepted outputs on retrieval or validation failure. Other sources continue;
independent publisher inventories, baseline limits and final candidate checks
govern admission. Supplemental observations can record an explicit unavailable
state. A source cannot grant itself new authority or revise its acceptance policy.

An always-run alert step reads the source results when a report exists. It
deduplicates quarantine issues by source, reopens recurring failures and closes
only explicit accepted recoveries. After validation, a repository-scoped App
opens a ready data PR so independent CI and security workflows run. Automatic
merge requires the expected App identity, the exact tested SHA, allowed JSON
changes and a clean protected-branch merge state. It does not admit schema,
refresh-policy, refresh-contract, application or workflow changes. A failed gate
prevents publication; routine successful refreshes require no human approval.

## Browser policy

- Pull requests use Chromium with two functional shards, axe accessibility checks, and three deliberate visual snapshots.
- Nightly verification runs the complete functional suite in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- Every nightly browser shard and the accessibility suite write a unique blob
  report name and retain GitHub-readable failure output before reports merge.
- Browser binaries are installed only for the engine each job needs. They are not cached until timing data justifies that complexity.

## Deployment guarantees

Production deployment never rebuilds routine releases. The deploy workflow downloads `site-build`, verifies that `release.json` matches the successful CI run SHA, and publishes through native GitHub Pages permissions. One bounded readiness job waits for that exact SHA at the public edge before production smoke and Lighthouse begin. It fails if the SHA does not appear within ten minutes, the publication window documented by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). Both production checks then test the verified release.
